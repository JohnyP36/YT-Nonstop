## Rules for Contributing

### Issues 
**Allways** use the issue templates: 
 - use [this template](https://github.com/JohnyP36/YT-Nonstop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=newest+version.yml) for issues regarding the newest version of my extension
 - for issues regarding the [`1.5.5 version`](https://github.com/JohnyP36/YT-Nonstop/tree/main/1.5.5_OLD%20VERSION) use [this template](https://github.com/JohnyP36/YT-Nonstop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=OLD&template=older+versions.md)
If the issue template isn't followed your issue will be labeled as `invalid` and be closed
---
### Pull requests
Use the template that has been made available for this.
#### Don't pull a request for just one or two (max. four issues). Only pull request if there are a lot of changes at once.

### Commit message
Keep it simple. 
 1. Put in the title box `A:` if something is added, `C` for changing something and an `R` for removing something. 
 2. Put here after the file name of the file you changed
 3. At the end put the issue number if appliable. 
So `C: js/background.js fix #74` or `R: manifest.json fix #75`. The issue itself will contains all the details.
