# YT-Nonstop
Extension to let YouTube run nonstop with autoplay, autoconfirm and automatic pressing the loopbutton.

You can find this extension in the [Microsft Edge store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/yt-nonstop/ljhaomibkgdhmfdiglflmkijdbiejcom).

### [1.5.5_OLD VERSION](https://github.com/JohnyP36/YT-Nonstop/tree/main/1.5.5_OLD%20VERSION)
This is an older version of my extension. But the `autoplay` function doesn't work anymore, because YouTube changed their site. 

#### The following files need do be changed: 
 - [background2.js](https://github.com/JohnyP36/YT-Nonstop/blob/main/1.5.5_OLD%20VERSION/js/background2.js)
 - [autoplay.js](https://github.com/JohnyP36/YT-Nonstop/blob/main/1.5.5_OLD%20VERSION/js/autoplay.js)
 - and maybe: [jquery-3.2.1.min.js](https://github.com/JohnyP36/YT-Nonstop/blob/main/1.5.5_OLD%20VERSION/js/jquery-3.2.1.min.js)

### [1.6.0](https://github.com/JohnyP36/YT-Nonstop/tree/main/1.6.0)
This is now (april 30, 2021) the newest version of my extension. 

#### Need help!
If you see something wrong or incorrect start an issues and let me know what I should change.
