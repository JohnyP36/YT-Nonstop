### [1.5.5_OLD VERSION](https://github.com/JohnyP36/YT-Nonstop/tree/old/1.5.5_OLD%20VERSION)
This is an older version of my extension. But the `autoplay` function doesn't work anymore, because YouTube changed their site. 

#### The following files need do be changed: 
 - [background2.js](https://github.com/JohnyP36/YT-Nonstop/blob/old/1.5.5_OLD%20VERSION/js/background2.js)
 - [autoplay.js](https://github.com/JohnyP36/YT-Nonstop/blob/old/1.5.5_OLD%20VERSION/js/autoplay.js)
 - and maybe: [jquery-3.2.1.min.js](https://github.com/JohnyP36/YT-Nonstop/blob/old/1.5.5_OLD%20VERSION/js/jquery-3.2.1.min.js)

### [1.6.0](https://github.com/JohnyP36/YT-Nonstop/tree/main/1.6.0)
